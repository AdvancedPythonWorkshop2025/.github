## Essential Techniques in Data Analysis and Code Management for Research Projects

Welcome to the **Advanced Python Workshop**! This 20-hour course is designed to help researchers move beyond single-script, single-data-file analyses and adopt best practices in version control, collaboration, data management, modular coding, workflow orchestration, and environment management. If you’re eager to make your research code more robust, reproducible, and scalable, you’re in the right place!
